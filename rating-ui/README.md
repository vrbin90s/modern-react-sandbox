# Rating UI (React + Vite)

A simple React project that implements an interactive star-rating widget to demonstrate and build understanding of React’s core fundamentals.

It focuses on:
- Props – passing data from parent to child components
- State – managing dynamic values with useState
- Derived UI – rendering stars dynamically based on rating and hover state
- Event Handling – capturing user interactions such as clicks and hovers
